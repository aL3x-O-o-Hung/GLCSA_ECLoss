# Cross-Slice Attention and Evidential Critical Loss for Uncertainty-Aware Prostate Cancer Detection

This is the official code implementation of our MICCAI paper [Cross-Slice Attention and Evidential Critical Loss for Uncertainty-Aware Prostate Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01146)

This is a followup work of our previous works, [CSAM: A 2.5D Cross-Slice Attention Module for Anisotropic Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation](https://github.com/aL3x-O-o-Hung/CSAM) and [CAT-Net: A Cross-Slice Attention Transformer Model for Prostate Zonal Segmentation in MRI](https://github.com/aL3x-O-o-Hung/CAT-Net)
